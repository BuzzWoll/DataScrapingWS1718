# DataScrapingWS1718

This repository hosts a python file needed for the notebook in this repository.
This project was done as a submission for the data scraping course at Humboldt University in WS1718.
It was designed to be used on Windows 10, python3 and jupyter notebook. I have not tried to run it anywhere else.
